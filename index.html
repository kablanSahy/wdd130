            <p>Hi, I'm SAHY KABLAN BENEDICT, currently a student at BYU-Idaho. 
                I am passionate about computer development and enjoy exploring the exciting challenges that the world of programming has to offer.
                My academic background is enriched by my constant quest to learn and grow in the development field.
                Apart from the lines of code, another passion that defines me is the piano. My fingers find their way across the keys, creating melodies that express my deep connection with the art of music. 
                It's a form of expression that allows me to give free rein to my creativity.
                On the football pitch, I commit myself with the same intensity and determination. 
                It's a place where I find balance, camaraderie and the joy of competing.
                In short, I'm someone who seeks to harmonise technology, art and sport in my daily life. 
                My academic journey, my passion for development, my musical moments on the piano and my adventures on the football pitch all help to shape my versatility and my constant desire to evolve in various aspects of my life.</p>

            <h2>ABIDJAN</h2>
            <img src="images/ivory_coast.jpeg" alt="Hello, economic capital of the ivory coast" >
            <p><strong>Abidjan</strong> is the largest city and the economic capital of the Ivory Coast. As of the 2021 census, Abidjan's population was 6.3 million,[3] which is 21.5 percent of overall population of the country, making it the sixth most populous city proper in Africa, after Lagos, Cairo, Kinshasa, Dar es Salaam, and Johannesburg. A cultural crossroads of West Africa, Abidjan is characterised by a high level of industrialisation and urbanisation. It is also the most populous Dioula-speaking and French-speaking city in Africa (Kinshasa being mainly Lingala-speaking).

                The city expanded quickly after the construction of a new wharf in 1931, followed by its designation as the capital city of the then-French colony in 1933. The completion of the Vridi Canal in 1951 enabled Abidjan to become an important sea port. Abidjan remained the capital of the Ivory Coast after its independence from France in 1960. In 1983, the city of Yamoussoukro was designated as the official political capital of Ivory Coast.
                
                However, Abidjan has officially been designated as the "economic capital" of the country, because it is the largest city in the country and the centre of its economic activity. Many political institutions and all foreign embassies continue to be located in Abidjan as well. The Abidjan Autonomous District, which encompasses the city and some of its suburbs, is one of the 14 districts of Ivory Coast.</p> <p>Source: Wikipedia</p>
