        <p>Hello my name is Sahy Kablan Benedict, i'm from Ivory Coast</p>
        <p>Hi, I'm Sahy Kablan Benedict, currently a student at BYU-Idaho. 
            I am passionate about computer development and enjoy exploring the exciting challenges that the world of programming has to offer.
             My academic background is enriched by my constant quest to learn and grow in the development field.
             Apart from the lines of code, another passion that defines me is the piano. My fingers find their way across the keys, creating melodies that express my deep connection with the art of music. 
             It's a form of expression that allows me to give free rein to my creativity.
             On the football pitch, I commit myself with the same intensity and determination. 
             It's a place where I find balance, camaraderie and the joy of competing.
             In short, I'm someone who seeks to harmonise technology, art and sport in my daily life. 
             My academic journey, my passion for development, my musical moments on the piano and my adventures on the football pitch all help to shape my versatility and my constant desire to evolve in various aspects of my life.</p>
